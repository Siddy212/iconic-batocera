# Iconic (Batocera Version)
Iconic is an EmulationStation-DE theme that aims to provide a modern UI appearance while also highlighting famous characters from each system.

This is a derivation of Siddy212's original theme **Iconic (ES-DE Version)**: https://github.com/Siddy212/iconic-es-de

# Overview
I'm brand new to creating themes for CFWs and thought it'd be best to try to port one that I liked to learn how it all works. 

- `Aspect Ratio`
  - `4:3`: I only own an RG35XX+ so this is currently the only aspect ratio that's supported. Batocera scales and renders images differently than EmulationStation-DE so the background art had to be reworkd to make the overlays align properly.
 
- `Gamelist Views`
    - `All`: There is currently no difference between the various theme options -- they all result in a Textlist game list with detailed metadata.

- `Theme Color Scheme`
  - `Classic Light`: This is the only provided color scheme at this time.
 
# Future Tasks
- Classic Dark Color Scheme
- Grid: Boxart View
